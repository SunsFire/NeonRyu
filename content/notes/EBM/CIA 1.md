- Divided into:
  - **Positive Economics** (Describes "what is")
  - **Normative Economics** (Analyzes "what ought to be")

## 📌 Demand & Supply 🔄

### 🔺 Demand (Consumer Perspective)
💡 **Definition**: The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at different prices in a given time period.
- **Law of Demand** 📉: Higher price = Lower demand (inverse relationship).

📊 **Factors Affecting Demand**: <br>
1. **Price of the commodity** 🏷️ – Higher price 🔼 = Lower demand 🔽.<br>
2. **Price of related goods** 🔄:<br>
   - **Substitutes** 🥤 (e.g., Pepsi vs Coca-Cola) – If Pepsi's price rises, demand for Coca-Cola increases.
   - **Complements** ⛽🛵 (e.g., Petrol & Scooters) – If petrol price rises, demand for scooters falls.
3. **Consumer Income** 💰 – Higher income = More demand for normal goods.<br>
4. **Taste & Preferences** 🎭 – Changing trends affect demand.<br>
5. **Government Policies** ⚖️ – Higher taxes increase prices and reduce demand.<br>
6. **Population Size & Distribution** 👥 – More people = Higher demand.<br>

### 🔻 Supply (Producer Perspective)
💡 **Definition**: The total quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to sell at different prices.
- **Law of Supply** 📈: Higher price = More supply (direct relationship).

📊 **Factors Affecting Supply**:
1. **Price of Commodity** 🏷️ – Higher price 🔼 = More supply 🔼.
2. **Firm Goals** 🎯 – Profit-oriented firms increase production when profit margins are high.
3. **Input Costs** 🛠️ – Higher costs (land, labor, capital) reduce supply.
4. **Technology** 🤖 – Advanced tech = More supply.
5. **Government Policies** 📜 – High taxes reduce supply; subsidies increase it.
6. **Future Expectations** 🔮 – If prices are expected to rise, firms may reduce supply now.
7. **Natural Factors** 🌦️ – Weather, disasters, and climate impact supply.

## 📌 Elasticity of Demand 🎯

💡 **Measures how much demand changes in response to price/income/related goods.**

### 📊 Price Elasticity of Demand
- **Perfectly Elastic** (🔄 Small price change = Huge demand change)
- **Perfectly Inelastic** (🛑 Price change = No demand change)
- **Relatively Elastic** (💡 Price up 10% = Demand down 20%)
- **Relatively Inelastic** (⚖️ Price up 10% = Demand down 5%)
- **Unitary Elastic** (🔄 Price up 10% = Demand down 10%)
